### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a native Texan, a proud wife, and a mom of three wonderful kids. My professional journey has led me to the fascinating world of software engineering. I'm captivated by how it seamlessly blends creativity, functionality, and intricate problem-solving. I also find it deeply rewarding to be able to turn an idea - something that didn't exist before - into something tangible.

In my free time, you'll often find me immersed in the world of gaming. I'm an avid gamer and enjoy the thrill of exploration, deep lore, and competition.

I'm deeply passionate about advocacy and activism, particularly in the healthcare arena. As someone who navigates the challenges of rare diseases, I'm committed to making a positive impact and driving change. I believe that every voice matters when it comes to healthcare advocacy.
